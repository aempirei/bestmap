bestmap takes two file lists and cross-compares the files via diff,
and optionally, gzip, to determine the optimal mapping between the
file lists to maximize total file similarity. a matching file should
be generated after a successful run. run bestmap with no parameters to
view the parameter options. some configuration options can be found in
the etc/ directory

you need perl, bash, gzip and diff.

you need the Algorithm::Munkres CPAN module.

bestmap.sh is the primary script you run against a pair of file lists.

bipartite.pl is called from bestmap.sh but it can also be run against
a weights file.

that should be it.
