bestmap takes two file lists and cross-compares the files via diff, and optionally, gzip,
to determine the optimal mapping between the file lists to maximize total file similarity.
a matching file should be generated after a successful run. run bestmap with no parameters
to view the parameter options. some configuration options can be found in etc/

you need perl, bash, gzip and diff.

you need the Algorithm::Munkres CPAN module.

that should be it.
